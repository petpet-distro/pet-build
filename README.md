# petbuild!!!
This is the ports repository for petbuild, the thingie that actually builds
the ports!

**NOTE**: petbuild is a **VERY** rough prototype right now, it is NOT production ready,
and in fact, it is so not production ready, if you run it anywhere outside
of a sealed place, it may or may not meow itself and everything else up.
